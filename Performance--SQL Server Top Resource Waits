SQL Server Top Resource Waits

--https://jonlabelle.com/snippets/view/sql/sql-server-top-resource-waits

-- Lists the longest resource waits for a server instance, helping you to locate
-- bottlenecks
-- 
-- Wait statistics are cumulative, and calculated since the last SQL Server
-- restart or statistics reset.
-- 
-- SQL Server collects data for many different wait types; refer to SQL Server
-- Books Online for more information about each wait type.
-- 
-- For example, if the top wait types are disk I/O related, you could use
-- Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) such as sys.dm_io_pending_io_requests and
-- sys.dm_io_virtual_file_stats to analyse the problem in more detail.
-- 
-- You can specify a Wait time limit (%) before you run the script (default 1%).
-- Only wait types with values higher than the percentage you specify will be
-- listed.

set @wait_time_limit = 1;
