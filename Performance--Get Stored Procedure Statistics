-- Name, Schema, Last Execution Time, Modify Date, Create Date and Execution
-- count since reboot.

select db_name(proc_stats.database_id) as dbname,
    sc.name as [schema],
    obj.name,
    proc_stats.last_execution_time,
    obj.modify_date,
    obj.create_date,
    proc_stats.execution_count
from sys.dm_exec_procedure_stats as proc_stats
inner join sys.objects as obj
    on obj.object_id = proc_stats.object_id
inner join sys.schemas as sc
    on obj.schema_id = sc.schema_id
where obj.type = 'P'
order by dbname,
    sc.name,
    obj.name;

-- You can look in the plan cache to get a pretty good idea of Stored Procedure
-- usage. Take this query, for instance:

select
    db_name(st.dbid) as database_name,
    object_name(st.objectid) as name,
    p.usecounts,
    p.size_in_bytes / 1024 as size_in_kb,
    st.text,
    p.objtype
from sys.dm_exec_cached_plans as p
     cross apply sys.dm_exec_sql_text(p.plan_handle) as st
where
    p.objtype = 'Proc'
and st.dbid = db_id('DATABASE_NAME_HERE')
order by p.usecounts desc;

-- This will give you the "usecounts" of the stored procedures that are cached
-- pertaining to SomeDB.
--
-- Note: the plan cache contains the execution plans. This retention of these
-- plans has many factors involved. Whereas this will give you a good idea of
-- what is being used and how often, it's definitely not the running total of
-- stored procedures and how often/when they were executed.
