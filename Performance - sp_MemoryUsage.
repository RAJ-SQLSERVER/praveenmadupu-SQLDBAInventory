locked_page_allocations: If this is > 0 means Locked Pages is enabled for SQL Server which is one of the best practice

available_commit_limit: This indciates the available amount of memory that can be committed by the process sqlservr.exe

page_fault_count: Pages fetching from the page file on the hard disk instead of from physical memory. Consistently high number of hard faults per second represents Memory pressure.
