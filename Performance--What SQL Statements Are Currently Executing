-- What SQL Statements Are Currently Executing Utility

--
-- The SQL used in this utility ‘dba_WhatSQLIsExecuting’ is given in Listing 1.
--
-- The Dynamic Management View (DMV) sys.db_exec_requests shows which requests
-- are currently executing, the information shown includes the handle to the
-- whole SQL text of the batch or stored procedure (sql_handle), together with
-- offsets relating to the section of SQL within the batch that is currently
-- executing (statement_start_offset and statement_end_offset).
--
-- To determine the current section of SQL currently executing, we need to call
-- the Dynamic Management Function (DMF) sys.dm_exec_sql_text, passing in the
-- handle of the SQL batch that is currently executing, and then apply the
-- relevant offsets.
--
-- We can get more information about the query by combining the
-- sys.db_exec_requests DMV with the sys.processes system view (joined on
-- spid/session_id). This information includes who is executing the query, the
-- machine they are running from, and the name of the database.
--
-- The utility selects relevant fields from the sys.db_exec_requests and
-- sys.sysprocesses views. The selected fields are described in figure 1
-- (largely taken from SQL Server 2005 Books online).
