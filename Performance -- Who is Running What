-- Who is Running What?
-- 
-- Lists each session running on an instance, including login, query, and status
-- information
-- 
-- This script provides a quick overview of who is currently running commands on
-- a SQL Server instance. The exact command being run is listed (for example, a
-- SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, or BACKUP DATABASE statement), with the associated
-- user login.
-- 
-- Additional information includes the session status (Background, Running,
-- Runnable, Sleeping, or Suspended), and the database name.
-- 
-- The Session ID is also shown; this is useful if you need to terminate a user
-- process using the KILL command.
-- 
-- Note that the user login shown for a session may be different to the user
-- login that originally created the session. This can happen if the session has
-- been subject to context switches (using the 'EXECUTE AS' command, for
-- example).
